               <h3>My Future Plans</h3>
                    <p> My to-do list's bigger than I would like to admit. There is just so much in this tiny little universe to discover. 
                    As I'm good at solving problems and have a weird liking towards technology , I want to develope any sort of software/machine that enable the human race to do the impossible. </p>
                    <p>
                    Last but not the least , I really want to observe the Halley's Comet with my own eyes as well as an Aurora. </p>
                    <p>
                    The future lies in the exploring human minds and nature.And that can be done incorporating psychology and computer science.As a student of information and communication engineering I see myself lurking into that field. </p>

               <h3>Reminiscing the good old GSC days</h3>
               <p>
                   So my days at GSC are finally over.This has been quite a strange journey for me.I have seen both sides of the coin in this one and half year.I was a bit frustrated,felt really uncomfortable in the first 6 months.But the last 6 months have been absolutely amazing owing to the awesome bonding between the brothers of section E.But right when I started enjoying every second of my college life it all just ended. That's life and I just can't complain about that.One special thing that GSC provides is an amazing teaching staff.No one has ever dared to question about the dedication and integrity of the teachers of GSC.I really owe them.My college life would have been really boring if Safa,Rakib Nihat,Rifat Hossain Akib ,Shohan and Fahim wasn't there to cheer me up and support me in every circumstanes.That's all from me.
